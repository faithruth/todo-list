# Simple Todo List

I created a gist to help out a friend who was being introduced to php.
This todo list is a simpe application that demostates how php can be connecte to a databse and how CRUD actions can be performed in the case of a todolist.
The is a consistent use of ajax in performing the different CRUD actions

Here is the link to the gist https://gist.github.com/faithruth/82bfea9650b3dc9a2518b1dee99d9a50
