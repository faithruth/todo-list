# Simple Todo List

I created a gist to help out a friend who was being introduced to php.
This todo list is a simpe application that demostates how php can be connected to a databse and how CRUD actions can be performed in the case of a todolist.
It also demonstrates the application of ajax in the CRUD events.

Here is the link to the gist https://gist.github.com/faithruth/82bfea9650b3dc9a2518b1dee99d9a50
